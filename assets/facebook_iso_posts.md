# 🏘️ System 3: The "Neighborly" ISO Engine (Facebook Groups)
>
> **Goal:** Generate inbound leads from local community groups (e.g., "What's Happening in [City]") without getting banned for "Advertising".
> **Strategy:** The "Anti-Ad". Look like a neighbor, not a company.
> **Rule:** Use imperfect grammar, no logos, and no "We Buy Houses" slogan.

## 📝 **Script 1: The "Project Hunter"**

*Target: Ugly houses / Fixer-uppers.*
*Why it works: People love to help with "projects" or "hobbies".*

**Post Text:**
"Looking for a project house in [City/Neighborhood] to work on this winter. Doesn't need to be pretty (actually, the uglier the better lol).

My partner and I are looking for something that needs roof work or a cleanout. If you know of a neighbor thinking of selling, or a house that’s been sitting empty for a while, could you let me know?

Not a realtor, just looking for our next project. Thanks guys! 🙏"

**The "Soft" CTA:** "Drop me a DM if you know of one!"

## 📝 **Script 2: The "Specific Buyer"**

*Target: Specific Zip Code or School District.*
*Why it works: Specificity breeds trust. Scammers are vague; neighbors are specific.*

**Post Text:**
"Long shot, but does anyone know someone selling a 3bd house near [School Name] or in the [Zip Code] area?

My lender says I can close quickly if I find the right one, but everything on Zillow is going crazy with bidding wars. We don't mind if it needs updates (carpet/paint is fine).

Just trying to buy direct to save everyone the fees. TIA!"

## 📝 **Script 3: The "Help a Friend"**

*Target: Broad outreach.*
*Why it works: Asking for a "friend" removes the sales pressure from you.*

**Post Text:**
"Asking for a friend - he's looking to buy a house in [City] asap. He's paying cash so he doesn't have to deal with inspections and banks.

He asked me if I knew anyone selling an inherited house or a rental they’re tired of. I told him I’d ask here. 🤷‍♂️

If you know anyone, can you message me? trying to help him find something this month."

## 📝 **Script 4: "The Handyman Special"**

*Target: Distressed properties.*
*Why it works: Filters for motivation immediately.*

**Post Text:**
"Does anyone have a house they just want 'gone'?

I know that sounds weird, but I'm looking for a property that might have too much stuff in it, or needs too many repairs to list with an agent. I have a crew that handles cleanouts.

If you have a headache property you want to turn into cash, shoot me a message. I promise I'm easy to work with."

---

## 📝 **Script 5: "The Landlord Exit"**

*Target: Tired Landlords in Investing Groups.*

**Post Text:**
"Any landlords in here tired of the new regulations/taxes?

I'm looking to pick up 1-2 more doors in [City]. I don't care if there are tenants in there (even if they're behind on rent).

If you're looking to offload a headache before the end of the year, let's chat. I can close fast."

---

## 📝 **Script 6: "The Specific Street" (Sniper)**

*Target: Hyper-local.*

**Post Text:**
"Does anyone know the owner of the vacant house on [Street Name]? The one with the [Blue Siding / Overgrown Grass]?

It’s been sitting for a while and I’d love to get in touch to see if they want to sell it before winter hits. Hate to see it sit empty.

If you know them, please DM me! Thanks neighbors."

---

## 📝 **Script 7: "The Cash Budget"**

*Target: Direct intent.*

**Post Text:**
"I have a budget of $[Amount] to buy a house in [City] this month. The catching is, it has to be OFF market (no agents).

I'm okay with:

- Old roof
- Water in basement
- Outdated kitchen

If you're thinking of selling and don't want to pay the 6% commission, send me a message. Let's see if we can make a deal."

## 💡 **The Comments Strategy ("The Bump")**

*Don't just post and leave. You need to keep it at the top of the feed.*

1. **Reply to everyone:** Even if they just tag a friend. "Thanks [Name]! I'll message them."
2. **The "Safety" Bump (Day 2):** "Wow, thanks for the messages guys. Still looking if anyone else knows of anything!"
3. **The "Found One" Bump (Day 7):** "Found one property on [Street], but still looking for one more! Keep them coming!"
